## WAMP clients as separate works

We see any code which connects to Crossbar.io via WAMP as a separate work. The Crossbar.io license (the AGPL v3) does not apply to WAMP clients. This applies irrespective of where these run, i.e. also to components which are run side-by-side within an native worker of type router, which are run in a native worker of type container or in a guest worker. We promise to stand by this view of the license.
If you need further assurance, you can email us at service@tavendo.de for a signed letter asserting the above promise.

We release all our client libraries (those provided by the [Autobahn project](http://autobahn.ws/) under non-copyleft licenses, which allow their use for closed-source & commercial software. For other client libraries see their respective licenses (these appear to be universally non-copyleft as well).
