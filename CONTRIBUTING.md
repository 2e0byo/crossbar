Contributing to Crossbar.io is totally welcome! We love open source and community collaboration. All of Crossbar.io development is fully open here on GitHub and there are no private, closed areas that exclude you and the Crossbar.io community.

## Filing Issues

We track **issues** in the GitHub issue tracker [here](https://github.com/crossbario/crossbar/issues).

An issue is either a **bug** (an unexpected / unwanted behavior of the software or incorrect documentation) or a **feature** (a desire for new functionality / behavior in the software or new documentation).

A **question** though is *not* an issue - as in, it isn't handled in our issue tracker by purpose / policy.

So if you have found a bug or want to propose a new feature, please file an issue. But if you have a question, please see [Asking Questions](#Asking Questions)

### Filing Bugs

If you file a **bug issue**, please provide at least the following information:

1. output of `crossbar version`
2. error/log output (eg a traceback)
3. steps to reproduce the issue

> A bug issue should also be only about **one thing** - if you have found multiple related things, please file multiple issues and link the issues (cross referencing by mentioning the related issues in the descriptions - that will make GitHub automatically add respective links).

### Filing Features

When proposing a new **feature**, please provide the following:

1. your actual **use case** and your **goals**
2. *why* this important for you
3. optionally, a proposed solution

> Describing your use case and goals, rather than only / directly jumping into a specific, concrete proposal for a solution is very important. As this allows us to take into account the bigger picture. If you "only" propose concrete solution, and that doesn't fit in, we might need to reverse engineer your actualy use case / goals first to then come up with a solution that fits.

### Asking Questions

A question about Crossbar.io is neither a bug nor a feature. **Hence, if you have a question, please DO NOT file an issue, but consider asking on one of the following channels.**

Questions are best asked here:

* on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/crossbario)
* on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=crossbar,wamp) or
* on IRC channels (`#autobahn` and `#crossbar` at `chat.freenode.net`).

> When you file an issue that is considered a mere question, your issue likely will get closed without any further discussion or reply. You might find that unpleasant or non-cooperative. We are sorry! It is meant to be rude, but the reasons are: a) we are running this project on limited resources and b) the issue tracker should stay focused and not drown in noise.

## Contributing Code

Write me.

## Contributing Documentation

Contributions to the documentation are highly welcome! Crossbar.io is a complex software, users have varying degrees of background and experience and we have limited resources. Also, developers of Crossbar.io usually don't have a **user perspective** (anymore) - but docs should be for users.

Write me.
