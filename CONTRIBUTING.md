## Filing Issues

We track **issues** in the GitHub issue tracker [here](https://github.com/crossbario/crossbar/issues).

An issue is either a **bug** (an unexpected / unwanted behavior of the software or incorrect documentation) or a **feature** (a desire for new functionality / behavior in the software or new documentation).

A **question** though is NOT an issue (as in, it isn't handled in our issue tracker by purpose / policy).

So if you have found a bug or want to propose a new feature, please file an issue. But if you have a question, please see [Asking Questions](#Asking Questions)

### Filing Bugs

If you file a **bug issue**, please provide at least the following information:

1. output of `crossbar version`
2. error/log output (eg a traceback)
3. steps to reproduce the issue

A bug issue should also be only about **one thing** - if you have found multiple related things, please file multiple issues and link the issues (cross referencing by mentioning the related issues in the descriptions - that will make GitHub automatically add respective links).

### Filing Features

When proposing a new **feature**, please provide the following:

* your **use case** / your actual **goals**

### Asking Questions

A question about Crossbar.io is neither a bug nor a feature. **Hence, if you have a question, please DO NOT file an issue, but consider asking on one of the following channels.**

Questions are best asked here:

* on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/crossbario)
* on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=crossbar,wamp) or
* on IRC channels (`#autobahn` and `#crossbar` at `chat.freenode.net`).

> When you file an issue that is considered a mere question, your issue likely will get closed without any further discussion or reply. You might find that unpleasant or non-cooperative. We are sorry! It is meant to be rude, but the reasons are: a) we are running this project on limited resources and b) the issue tracker should stay focused and not drown in noise.

## Contributing Code

Write me.

## Contributing Documentation

Contributions to the documentation are highly welcome! Crossbar.io is a complex software, users have varying degrees of background and experience and we have limited resources
